// promise, asynchronous programming, and async/await are advanced topics in JavaScript that allow for handling asynchronous operations more effectively.
// fetch() is a modern way to make HTTP requests in JavaScript, returning a Promise that resolves to the Response object representing the response to the request. It is widely used for making API calls and handling data asynchronously.
